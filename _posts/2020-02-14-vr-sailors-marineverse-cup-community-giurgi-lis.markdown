We have asked Giurgi Lis a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*My parents sent me a sailing summer camp in Murcia when I was 10. Windsurfing, sailing, and others activities were the knowledge that I learned playing with others kids*.

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*I don't know why I fall in love with MarineVerse Cup, maybe the sailing camp I did as a kid..*

*When I put the game on for the first time and heard the sound of sea my full body reacted and when the sound of the start begin was a tremor on my legs with palpitations.*

*A few days since the beginning I won my first race that give other amount of feelings. Now I'm in Pro League struggling to improve. I made two videos for the people and more is coming. The community is great and give a lot of feedback because we all have love for MarineVerse Cup.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*All the people are welcome but those who have experience sailing will get more profit, also those interested in virtual reality simulators.*

*The game is still in development and there is still a lot to add..That's why community feedback is so important.*
