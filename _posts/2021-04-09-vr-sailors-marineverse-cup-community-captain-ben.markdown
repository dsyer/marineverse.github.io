We have asked Ben a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*I am a former Dinghy Instructor, Cruising Instructor, delivery skipper and now a Master 500 Yacht captain.*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*Delivering a new Bavaria 37ft sailing yacht from Swansea to Lanzarote in 2006 with tail winds from Hurricane Gordon & Hurricane Hellen in the Bay of Biscay. Being at the bottom of the wave troughs was like being back home in the valleys, and sitting at the top of the waves were giving us vertigo!! Great learning experience!*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*I found this game by chance on my Oculus quest 2 and its now the only game i play. I love how real it feels and the competitiveness between other skilled sailors.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*MarineVerse Cup is for everyone at every level. Once the rules are implemented into the game it will become a lot for competitive. Understandable time trial/ghost sailing is hard to implement sailing rules but lets see what the future holds..*

**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in MarineVerse Cup?**

*My crew have also downloaded this game and they follow my lines and try to learn as i im sailing ahead of them. Its a great way to learn and it would still be great if we can have other OQ2 players in the same boat to teach.*
