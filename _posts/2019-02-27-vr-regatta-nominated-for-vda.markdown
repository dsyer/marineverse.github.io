Sailing education is something we are very passionate about and weâ€™re very honoured to be recognized by Viveport's team for our efforts in this space.

The nomination is great news for virtual reality sailing. As a nominee, we already know that VR Regatta will receive great support from Viveport team ( *at least 15K USD, a professionally recorded video about MarineVerse and access to latest VR dev-kits like Vive Cosmos* ). This additional resources will enable us to deliver quicker on our mission to democratize sailing.
