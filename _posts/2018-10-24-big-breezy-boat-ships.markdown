VR studio [MarineVerse](https://www.marineverse.com/) was founded by a small group of
passionate sailors and technologists, spread across the
globe and working together through the internet. Big
Breezy Boat is their second title focused on virtual reality
sailing after [VR Regatta](https://www.marineverse.com/vr-regatta/presskit) and incorporates experience
gained while working on the first project.

Big Breezy Boat ( B3 ) is a simple relaxing sailing
experience with co-op multiplayer between mobile and PC
VR. B3 is great for casual relaxing or a quick demo to
people not familiar with virtual reality.

B3 was designed for a multiplayer sailing with friends/kids
for people who own both Oculus Go and PC VR headset.

VR Arcade owners will be happy to learn that B3 is
primarily a standing experience.

For those who prefer sailing solo - there is a single player mode with a couple of islands to discover.
