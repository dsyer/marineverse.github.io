Ahoy!

MarineVerse Cup is a competitive VR sailing game that wants to bring multiplayer yacht racing to every VR headset owner.

We're creating MarineVerse Cup for both gamers who enjoy advanced simulations, and sailors who want to sharpen their racing skills off the water. The game itself is a product of years of research, development, design, and testing.

MarineVerse Cup is currently in Free to Play alpha and you can [download it on Steam now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1035320/MarineVerse_Cup/).

The Cup offers daily and weekly races, with varying wind conditions and courses that will test your sailing and racing skills. You will battle your way up the racing leaderboards and make friends along the way as you compete for the monthly MarineVerse Cup.

As MarineVerse we are committed to democratizing sailing. MarineVerse Cup has been designed for the latest generation of standalone VR headsets like Oculus Quest, making it easy for a casual sailor to get into virtual reality sailing.

With todayâ€™s release we're putting an early access build of the game into the your hands. We're looking for [community feedback](https://feedback.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup) and involvement to deliver a fun and authentic VR sailing experience.
