We have asked Romeo a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*10 years ago, While working in LA I moved to Marina Del Rey, and learned to sail at Blue Water Sailing School. I am ASA certified however I have not gone out enough to keep my skills and knowledge current.*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*One of the first time  I sailed before I was certified, was to help out in a race. My friend and I did not know what to expect and arrived late, as  we jumped on the boat a cannon went off, and the captain handed me a running stop watch and said call out the minutes then the seconds as we hit 6min. The start! We worked as a team as the captain shouted orders. It was Fantastic and ignited my Interest in sailing. We came in third place.*

*My favorite sailing memory was sailing through a huge pod of Dolphins moving south from Malibu to Long beach. It was magnificent.
A dolphin pod would be a great add to Big Breezy Boat.*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*I was interested in VR and purchased an Oculus Go and discovered the “Big Breezy Boat” and enjoyed getting on the VR ocean.*

*I upgraded to Oculus Quest and contacted Greg from MarineVerse team and wondered why I could not get the sailing app. Greg hooked me up with the alpha version of Marineverse Cup.*

*So while I am sheltering in place, I have been addicted to competing in sailing races daily!*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*If you can’t get to the ocean, or have no access to a sail boat.  Marineverse Cup is the perfect VR solution to improve you sailing knowledge and skill set. I would recommend it to any one who loves to escape, even while we are in lock down.*
