We have asked Pascal a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*None!*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*A few days trip in Mediterranee, many years ago... but with a skipper!*

*I was just on board and I just had to enjoy the experience. Of course, I learned a lot then about sailing, but forgot everything without practice since then.*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*In MarineVerse Cup, I immediately felt well thanks to the magical sound of the sea and waves. As I am blocked at home because of Covid19, I took this chance of escape in my Oculus Quest once a day with the practice race, in this nice game, both playing and learning.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*This game is relaxing and instructive. You can play with friends remotely in a race together. Or you can do like me: a short race everyday after work: 15 minutes are enough to play a race and relax.*

**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in MarineVerse Cup?**

*I am a good example of complete beginner. Marineverse includes well made tutorials to understand the basics.*
