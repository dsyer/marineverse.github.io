Great news, virtual sailing fans!

After more than a year in early access, VR Regatta: The Sailing Game officially launches today. Get that champagne bottle ready to smash on the bow* because this baby is seaworthy!

We’ve had a great time consulting with our faithful early adopters, implementing their feedback and adding in new features. The official version 1.0 release that has launched on Steam today had a bunch of cool new features. These include a new boat, a cute-and-simple Opti that brings the total in-game boats to three, and a whole new area to explore, the scorching hot equatorial region The Windy Islands.

If you’ve already bought VR Regatta then all of this is already yours—just update your game to the latest version and you’ll be good to go. If you’ve been waiting for the official release before getting on board, then we have some excellent news: during the launch week, we’ll be offering a 15% discount! Instead of US$14.99, you can grab the game for just US$12.74.

As always, we are endlessly grateful to everyone who has supported us by buying during early access, reporting bugs, signing up to this mailing list, and helping to spread the word. We’re so proud of this game, and we’re looking forward to making it even better in the future.

Cheers from the team at MarineVerse!

**Please don’t actually smash a bottle of champagne on your computer or VR headset. You’ll void your warranty and make everything very sticky.*
