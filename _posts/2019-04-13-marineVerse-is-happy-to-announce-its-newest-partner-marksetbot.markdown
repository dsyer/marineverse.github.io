Ahoy!

MarineVerse is happy to announce its newest partner: **MarkSetBot**.

MarkSetBot is the world’s first robotic sailing mark. Led by a team of passionate sailors and innovators, MarkSetBot strives to grow the sport of sailing and improve the quality of race management through all that they do.

MarkSetBot uses GPS technology to hold position and zero in on a specific location dictated through an app or webpage. Changing courses becomes simple as marks are moved by dragging a waypoint and pressing a button. All this can be accomplished with precision greater than that of traditional marks.

MarineVerse worked with MarkSetBot’s team to integrate the Bot into a custom build of VR Regatta. Try it at home ( by opting in into a “**marksetbot**” branch on Steam) or at MarkSetBot booth at one of their events.
