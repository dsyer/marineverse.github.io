Today we have reached a milestone **of 10,000 Pancake Sailors**!

As of now, over 10k users became sailors, while at home, to relax & explore Akalana Islands.

[At MarineVerse](https://www.marineverse.com/about), we are on the mission to promote sailing everyday by providing engaging interactive sailing experiences that motivate people to try the real sport.

With our sailing products, we are enabling sailors to stay connected to the sport and their sailing friends. For example, Pancake Sailor provides an accessible, free virtual sailing environment that provides ample social opportunities.

We're really excited by the Pancake Sailor reception. Thank you for joining our MarineVerse sailing community!

Hopefully, the world will find a solution to COVID-19 soon, and we will be able to go sailing not only virtually, but also in real life!

## VR Regatta? Multiplayer.

Pancake Sailor looks similar to VR Regatta, doesn't it? It's because in Pancake Sailor you are exploring the same location - Akalana Islands.

**The best bit? Pancake Sailor and VR Regatta multiplayer levels are connected.**

If you have a virtual reality headset and VR Regatta, you can now go sailing with your friends who just have Windows or Mac PC.
