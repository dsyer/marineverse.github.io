We have asked Kevin a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*I have been sailing IRL for about a year, so still an amateur. I have a 13 ft dinghy that I take out on the river. It's a locally made boat called a Gypsy.*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*Capsizing the boat twice, when my dad was teaching me how to sail just after I bought it.*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*Meeting people from around the world who I never would have met otherwise. Winning my first (standard) race, then winning a standard weekly series. Next is to win a pro race...*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*Anyone and everyone who enjoys competitive sailing or wants to learn how to sail - the controls are simple and user friendly.*


**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in MarineVerse Cup?**

*Download [Pancake Sailor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274800/Pancake_Sailor/) first (It's free on Steam). It's a great way to "learn the ropes" of sailing, as well as an enjoyable game in general. Then go onto MarineVerse Cup when you are ready to get competitive.*

*MarineVerse is a friendly and casual online sailing community. It's great that you can proudly represent your country while enjoying yourself out on the virtual water.*
