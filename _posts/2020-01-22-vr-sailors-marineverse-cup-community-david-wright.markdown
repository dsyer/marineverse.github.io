Ahoy!

Welcome to the first post in the series **"VR Sailors - MarineVerse Community"** - introducing sailors racing in [MarineVerse Cup](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup).

Today, we are chatting with **David Wright, Commodore at [Hythe Sailing Club in Southampton](https://hythesailingclub.co.uk/)**. In virtual reality, you can meet David in MarineVerse Cup as [Dave](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/race/aKLPc5I2d3CRfXP1nDcmPiBthfRCh7yxbsX-Mprn9AZSrl8).

We have asked David a couple of questions..

**What is your sailing experience?**

*My sailing experience is that since 10 years of age I sailed with my parents for three years on a 50 foot home built ferro-cement yacht in Portugal, Spain, Canary Islands (ARC Race for Cruisers) and the Caribbean up to age 13 then dinghies intermittently.  4 years ago I and my wife bought a Westerly Berwick at Hythe Sailing Club (Southampton)*.

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*I bought an Oculus Quest and Rift S and held an event at the club for members to have a go at setting a time in the guest race.  All that took part enjoyed the experience and we intend to run a series with a trophy for the winner in 2020.  We ran three tries and the third set your time which seemed to work very well.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*Marineverse Cup is a great way to develop skills and knowledge and for some fun for groups and clubs.  There is a great sense of achievement when you win a race and it takes practice to to actually win with a realistic level of challenge.*

*I highly recommend this experience for those new to sailing to help with an understanding of racing and sailing in the comfort of your own home or as a way to bring people together to experience Virtual Reality.  I also believe that this is a fun experience for those that have sailed for many years.*

*I look forward to seeing this sailing simulator/game develop in the future.*
