We have asked Jon a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*Grew up sailing small yachts and dinghy's. Started with Toppers then went on to Mirrors. Took part in many years of the P.A.S.A.B race. Penzance Around the Scilly Isles and Back.*.

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*Couldn't believe how realistic and immersive it was ! I remember leaning against the list as I tacked :) Racing against [Greg](https://www.marineverse.com/members/4NIvZp66M0QE9VXfFMM08x1-8vmOnObl7SNHxE2M7xXEluc), [Mike36](https://www.marineverse.com/members/6GWlyCupELr3XxXD5-sdkR9YlqLzOL5yOfQdJ-TJZC2SNlg) & [Aaron](https://www.marineverse.com/members/vAqwv4tLyFfJgnmK2QxCDDRpPkD2yV-xss5WYJwP8RWfJkw) have been great fun and really challenging. I think it brings out your competitive spirit ;-)*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*Everyone should try it ! You never know you might catch the bug. We have a great community on Discord you can join and lie about how if it wasn't for that wind change you'd have won ;-)*

*VR is going to really take off over the next few years with more standalone headsets likely to appear. The next gen "Quest" will take things to a whole new level so now is a really good time to get started.*

*VR to me is all about immersion. Graphics quality are only part of it and so far MarineVerse Cup is doing a great job of taking you from a miserable wet cold British winter to a warm yet windy sailing wonderland :-)*
