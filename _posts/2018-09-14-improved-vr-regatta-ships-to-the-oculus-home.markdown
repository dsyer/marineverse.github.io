Game studio [MarineVerse](https://www.marineverse.com/) was founded by a small group of passionate sailors and technologists, spread
across the globe and working together through the internet. VR Regatta is the product of years of
research, development, design, and testing. All of this has culminated in a product that is not only an
enjoyable video game experience, but also a solid introduction to the fundamentals of real sailing.

With this new updated release, players discovering sailing with the help of VR Regatta will be guided
through a unique onboarding experience that has been crafted based on hours of user tests and
continuous community feedback. Throughout their VR Regatta journey the players will be assisted by AI
instructor, Brian, who will offer relevant tips and advice based on player’s actions. This unique approach
will enable players to learn sailing at their own pace.

The team’s dedication to capturing the heart and soul of sailing has earned the admiration of several
sailing organisations, and the game has been demonstrated to the public at sailing exhibitions, sporting
events, and trade shows around the world.

VR Regatta: The Sailing Game could not have become a reality without the assistance of [Film Victoria’s
assigned production investment funding](https://www.film.vic.gov.au/funding/games-funding/). It is available today from [Oculus Store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1958452074228276/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/468240) for USD
$19.99 and is compatible with HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets
