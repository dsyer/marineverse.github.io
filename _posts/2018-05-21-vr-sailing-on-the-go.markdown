Big Breezy Boat ( B3 ) is a relaxing sailing experience for mobile VR.

If you like being on the open water, trimming sails and steering your yacht - you will find B3 very enjoyable!

One of the most exciting things about B3 is how affordable and accessible it is. If you or your friends donâ€™t have any virtual reality hardware, you can now join the fun for only $199 (assuming you are in the US ) ( full price of standalone Oculus Go headset, no mobile phone or PC required ) + $4.99 ( price of the app ).

With more VR sailors joining MarineVerse, we are get closer to online regattas and multi-crew adventures in virtual reality.
